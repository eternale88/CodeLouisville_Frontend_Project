## Synopsis

My first portfolio website (very close to my heart)  built from scratch with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap3, and jQuery - ## I have since built a new one [http://www.prowebdev.services/]  but this one still displays somes skills and inspiration that I would like to highlight.

## Motivation

To showcase the skills I learned in Code Louisville's Frontend Web Development program, Responsive Web Design, CSS positioning, JavaScript and provide 
a host for my future projects
